Following MRI\n   today, will stop propofol and assess RSBI. If he fails, I would then\n   resedate and ventilate him such that PaCO2 is in low 50's to achieve pH\n   less than 7.35; as bicarb comes up, further reduce ventilation and\n   achieve higher PaCO2.\n   Nutrition remains a problem because of difficulty getting access for\n   enteral or IV nutrition.

      "TITLE:\n   Chief Complaint:\n   HPI:\n   Mr. [**Known patient lastname 11148**] is a 45 y.o. Male with h.o. CML s/p allogenic transplant,\n   chronic GVH, bronchiolitis obliterans s/p recent discharge for\n   worsening dyspnea presented to the ED with hypoxia and altered mental\n   status.\n   On review of the pt's records it appears as if he was recently admitted\n   for a week for a LLL PNA, treated with a course of XX and discharged\n   yesterday. He was noted to have consolidation on CT chest and was going\n   to be treated at home with Levofloxacin and home O2. Unfortunately he\n   was not able to get his oxygen set up and he was admitted for his\n   dyspnea. During his admission it appears he was altered (?delirium)\n   remarking on voices telling him things per his wife. On review of OMR\n   it appears he signed out AMA, refused IV antibiotics, further\n   evaluation for his altered mental status and hypercarbia. He was\n   discharged on a regimen of Augmentin.\n   In the ED initial VS were noted to be BP 178/116, HR 130, Sat 91%. He\n   underwent a CXR which showed LLL infiltration/effusion. For his altered\n   mental status he underwent a CT head which showed an unchanged\n   hypodensity on R fontal and a new 6 mm hyperdense focus in the left\n   temporal lobe, ?mets versus hemorrhage. Neurology were consulted in the\n   ED and determined that his presentation could be infectious and\n   recommended an LP which was performed in the ED. Pt was started\n   empirically on Acyclovir, Ceftriaxone, Vanc, Flagyl.\n   .\n   On the floor he was noted to be range from non-verbal to verbal.\n   History was obtained via pt's wife.\n   Allergies:\n   Amphotericin B\n   Unknown;\n   Ambisome (Intraven.)

PNA: One review of prior films PNA appears to have progressed.\n   During his hospitalization he was treated with IV XX and discharged on\n   a course of Augementin x 10 days. Will continue on Ceftriaxone,\n   Levofloxacin for CAP, Vancomycin for HAP given recent\n   hospitalizations.\n   .\n   ##. Altered Mental Status: Ddx include delirium, meningitis, metastatic\n   disease. On review of pt's mentation prior to his AMA discharge I\n   suspect his mental status may be acute delirium from his underlying PNA\n   that was only able to be partially treated. Particularly given that at\n   times pt is non-verbal and at others he is able to speak. Other ddx to\n   consider given the fevers is meningitis.

      '45 yr old man w/CML who was discharged from [**Hospital1 52**] on [**3103-12-7**], readmitted\n   through EW [**3103-12-8**] with MS changes.  Oriented to self only.  Had head CT\n   that showed new 6mm hyperdense focus @ L temporal lobe-?metastatic\n   lesion vs small hemorrhage.  MD\ns think most likely infection\n   (toxoplasmosis or viral meningitis) vs brain CA.   To get MRI to better\n   diagnose.\n   Transplant, bone marrow (BMT)\n   Assessment:\n   Afebrile,  pt initially only responsive to nail bed stim on 45\n   mcg/kg/min propofol.  No tests done today not seen by neuro [**Doctor First Name 438**] .  nsr\n   no ectopy, bp 86/50-128/70 depending upon sleeping or aroused.\n   Hypoactive bowel. No bm x several days. c/o generalized pain.  Urine\n   output still 30-40cc/min.  skin intact but coccyx is very prominent.\n   General edema is increased.  No seizure activity\n   Action:\n   Decreased propofol to 40 mcg/ kg/min. and then to 30 mcg/kg/min while\n   sleeping.  encouraged team to contact [**Name (NI) 4964**] to eval MRI from [**12-12**]\n   for quality in assessing need to biopsy  brain on tues.  discussed poss\n   changing midline to picc for tpn.  Medicated with morphine for pain, 1\n   mg ivp x2 - 15 min apart.  Stopped infusing 125 cc/hr at 0800 and gave\n   1 x 5oo cc bolus for low U/O. skin care with turning with pillows under\n   both buttocks.\n   Response:\n   [**Month/Year (2) **] responded to teams call this eve but have not officially\n   rewiewed mri yet.   Morphine was very effective for pain allowing good\n   rest period but bp initially dropped from Map > 65 to map of 53-55 for\n   approx 15 min after morphine.  Urine output is slightly improved.  Pt\n   is still very angry and more combative on lower dose propofol when\n   awakened.\n   Plan:\n   When neuro [**Doctor First Name 438**] evals MRI quality may need repeat mri with dye. Need to\n   monitor for reaction to dye and poss give antiemetic prior to any MRI.\n   To remain intubated until after biopsy.

Patient closer to\n   hypercapneic baseline with current settings.   Will attempt to wean off\n   the vent at this point, barriers to extubation include LOS fluid + 15\n   liters.\n   -Lasix drip\n with goal\n([**1-7**]) liters per day\n   - Presure support/wean as tolerated\n   - Concentrate and d/c unnecessary antibiotics(vanc today)\n   .\n   ##. Unclear progress of Altered Mental Status: Ddx still includes\n   intermittent seizure vs. intracranial disease (glioma vs toxo vs other)\n   vs. delirium. This presentation seems to be acute on chronic AMS.  We\n   must r/o viral meningitises/encephalitises.  Will f/u on LP labs, HSV\n   PCR. Pt was noted to have auditory hallucinations which is interesting\n   given the ?mass in his temporal lobe.\n   Seizure:  During our brief windows into his mental status, off sedation\n   his mental status is HIGHLY variable, I have a STRONG clinical\n   suspicion that he is intermittently seizing and would benefit form 24\n   hour EEG monitoring.  Neuro help is greatly appreciated, they are\n   trying to arrange either 20 minute or 24 hour.\n            - Bolus sedation\n            - re-load phosphenytoin after EEG\n 1G Fosphenytoin once,\n   check a peak after 2 hours, maintainence levels 150mg Q8 check a level\n   in [**4-8**] days\n   Delerium:\n          - treatment dose abx should be d/c\nd, no microorganisms on\n   sputum\n   Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis:\n          - awaiting results of HSV, HHV-6, JCV, EBV\n All negative\n          - Serum cryptococcus is negative, toxo IgG, IgM - negative\n          - all culture data is negative\n          - Change Acyclovir to ppx dosing\n   Intracranial Disease Process:\n            - No biopsy\n   Toxic Metabolic:\n            - TSH is 7, likely to be sick euthyroid will check other\n   levels\n            - B12 WNL\n            - RPR non-reactive\n   .\n   Hyponatremia/ARF\n Will tolerate hypontremia, and ARF as total body\n   fluid overload is a barrier to extubation.  Lack of drop in sodium and\n   change in BUN/CRE likely represent intravascular redistribution of\n   third spaced fluids.  Would also question role of bactrim.\n   - hold boluses\n   - Check urine lytes\n   - Check PM lytes\n   - D/C bactrim, ppx otherwise\n   .\n   ##. PNA: along with prior hospital course has received an extended\n   course of abx.  Would stop if todays sputum is negative.\n   .\n   ##. CML s/p transplant: complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis\n   obliterans. Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue\n   on outpatient Prednisone dose.\n   - confirm various ppx meds\n   .\n   ##. HTN: Pt noted to have HTN with BP in 160s, HR 120s-130s. Baseline\n   HR usually low 100s, likely due to adrenergic tone from agitation.\n   ?autonomic dysregulation versus infection.\n   - restart labetalol\n   .\n   ##. FEN: unable to pass OG tube [**1-5**] intolerance, Will ask Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1705**] to\n   discuss IR guided OG tube with family.\n   .\n   ##. CODE STATUS: full\n   .\n   ##.

However, overnight pt. with\n   increased thick yellow secretions, shortness of breath and increased O2\n   requirements. Unsure if discharge will go as planned.\n   Respiratory failure, chronic\n   Assessment:\n   Yesterday pt. tolerated trach collar x8 hours. He was placed back on\n   PSV at 1800 and became tachypneic and hypoxic. Placed on AC. Of note,\n   pt.\ns wife was seen giving pt. drinks of water from cup while on trach\n   collar. At change of shift pt. with copious amounts of thick yellow\n   sputum. Short of breath despite any intervention. CXR done with\n   appeared unchanged from previous day. O2 requirements increased from\n   40% to 60%. Pt. refused blood gas.  Current settings AC: 60%/450/10/5\n   with sats 94-96%. Of note, pt. does have a large R sided pleural\n   effusion which IP felt did not need to tap as pt.\ns respiratory status\n   was stable yesterday am.\n   Action:\n   Pt. suctioned very frequently throughout shift for large amounts of\n   secretions. Emotional support given to pt. as he was extremely\n   nervous/anxious. Medicated with ativan 2mg x1 with good effect. CXR\n   done as noted above. Pt. continues to refuse blood gas.\n   Response:\n   Ongoing assessment. Pt. continues to have large amounts of secretions.\n   Continues to require high amounts of O2 to maintain sats.\n   Plan:\n   Unidentified cause of increased O2 requirements at this time. ? IR to\n   tap effusion as pt. is not unstable from respiratory standpoint.\n   Continue to wean vent as tolerated. Sputum culture to be obtained with\n   next suction. Unsure if rehab will accept pt. today. If they do his\n   page 2 is complete.\n\n',

Pt currently\n   not tolerating PO intake, has been noted to have increased coughing\n   with medications/liquids. Will keep him NPO for now with video swallow\n   planned for tomorrow AM. As mentioned previously family did not want\n   trach placed, NGT also undesirable/impossible given his recent nasal\n   intubation, sinusitis. Pt has poor opening of his mouth which would\n   make an OGT difficult too. Can consider TPN vs PPN whilst pt is NPO\n   however the concern would be whether this would be anything more than a\n   short term solution.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1705**] will discuss PEG with the family\n   shortly.\n   - f/u S&S eval tomorrow.\n   - NPO for now\n   .\n ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) with [**Last Name (STitle) 843**]\n   PO Diltiazem would be ideal however given he could not tolerate any PO\n   meds this AM and he is currently requiring a diltiazem gtt. Speech and\n   swallow are aware of him and will see him today. Adenosine EKG shows\n   clear A. flutter 2:1 with a rate of 150. t EP consult felt that D/C\n   cardioversion would be definitive treatment for A. Flutter, however\n   with new pneumonitis would hold off unitl\nnidus\n resolves. Further D/C\n   Cardioversion is complicated by the difficulty in protecting his airway\n   for sedation, and amiodarone is obviously a poor choice given his\n   underlying bonchiolitis obliterans.  Pt has h.o. of Heparin allergy. In\n   terms of the causes of his A. flutter with [**Name (NI) 843**] pt recently had an Echo\n   performed [**12-2**] which showed no evidence of valvular disease given his\n   history ischaemic injury is also low on the differential. Will check\n   TSH, T4 level.\n   - continue IV diltiazem gtt if pt is persistently in A. flutter with\n   [**Month/Day (4) 843**]\n   - Speech & swallow assessment tomorrow to determine whether pt is OK to\n   start PO regimen which would be ideal\n   - if no PO, would discuss PEG with family\n   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1705**] to discuss ablation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Will need\n   bivalirudin if we are considering ablation and wait until tomorrow\n   .\n   Chemical Pneumonitis: Pt noted to have a RLL infiltrate on CXR, likely\n   chemical pneumonitis from his aspiration event. No leukocytosis is\n   noted on lab draw, no fevers. His A. flutter predates his aspiration\n   event so it is unlikely to be the cause of his A. flutter. It could be\n   a factor in keep him in flutter if it develops into a PNA. Will not\n   treat for aspiration PNA given lack of infectious signs. If pt become\n   febrile or demonstrates leukocytosis would have a low threshold to put\n   on abx coverage for aspiration PNA.\n   .\n ALKALOSIS, METABOLIC\n   Likely contraction alkalosis given his recent history of poor PO\n   intake. His Creatinine is 1.0, which is likely high given his current\n   body habitus. Pt currently receiving NS IVF given his low BP prior to\n   dilt gtt initiation. Will continue to monitor I/Os, pt is going to\n   undergo speech and swallow eval today. On prior discussions with the\n   family they have decided against PEG tubes. NGT would be undesirable\n   given his severe sinus disease and recent nasal intubation.\n   - f/u S&S tomorrow\n   - follow electrolytes\n   .\n   Acute Kidney Injury\n   Suspect pre-renal for the same reason as above.\n   -Bolus 1L NS\n   .\n .H/O CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER\n   Complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. Pt was on\n   prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue on IV\n   methylprednisolone equivalent dose as he is strictly NPO.\n   - cont methylpred, for the moment with plans for taper\n   - cont ppx with azithromycin, bactrim and acyclovir IV\n   .\n ANEMIA, OTHER\n   Pt has chronic anemia with prior Hcts noted to be 25-26. On admission\n   is Hct was 33, however may be hemoconcentrated as he was clinically dry\n   on exam. Repeat Hct from floor draw was 19, no reports of hematochezia,\n   melena. Will review Metavision records to determine if pt had a femoral\n   line which would place him at risk for RP bld. However given the time\n   interval would be atypical.\n   - will recheck Hct\n ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)\n   Pt was initially admitted with AMS that was thought to be possibly\n   seizures given his known temporal lobe mass versus delirium given his\n   initial underlying PNA. Since his extubation last week he has remained\n   orientated to person, place, time.\n   - cont to monitor patient for signs of AMS\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition: NPO for now, replete lytes\n   Glycemic Control:\n   Lines: Rt Midline, 2 ports\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT: Pneumoboots\n   Stress ulcer: PPI IV\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status: Full code\n   Disposition: Pending resolution of symptoms\n   ------ Protected Section ------\n\n',

The retaining sutures were cut.  Local anesthesia with\n 6 cc of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine.  Using blunt dissection the retaining\n cuff of the catheter was freed from the subcutaneous tunnel.  The catheter was\n removed and hemostasis was ensured with direct manual compression at the base\n of the neck internal jugular vein puncture site.  A sterile dressing was\n applied over the tunnel entry site.  The patient was instructed to keep the\n head of bed elevated and/or to sit upright as much as possible today.  He is\n instructed not shower for 24 hours and then to cover the tunnel site as he\n would when the catheter was in place.  He was told not to submerse the area of\n the tunnel site for at least two weeks.\n\n IMPRESSION:  Successful removal of a left internal jugular vein tunneled 14.5-\n French double-lumen central venous catheter.  The catheter was examined and it\n was removed in its entirety.\n\n\n',

The left\n upper arm was prepared in the standard sterile fashion.  Ultrasound was used\n to localize a patent vein.  The left basilic vein was not visualized.  The\n left brachial vein presented patent and compressible.  After local anesthesia\n with 3 mL of lidocaine 1%, access was gained to the left brachial vein with a\n 21-gauge needle, under ultrasound guidance.  Hard copies of ultrasound images\n before and after establishing access were obtained to document vein patency.\n A 0.018 guidewire was advanced through the needle into the brachial vein.  The\n needle was then exchanged for a 5-French peel-away sheath.  The needle was\n further advanced into the superior vena cava, under fluoroscopic guidance.\n Based on the markers on the guidewire, it was determined that a length of 48\n cm would be suitable.  The PICC line was trimmed to this length and advanced\n over the wire under fluoroscopic guidance.  The wire was removed.  The\n catheter was flushed.  The catheter was secured to the skin with a StatLock,\n and the dressing was applied.\n\n COMPLICATIONS:  There were no immediate complications.\n\n IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of a double-lumen PICC line through the left\n brachial vein with tip in the superior vena cava.

Assess\n for changes in other abnormalities in comparison to prior studies.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  MDCT- acquired axial images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were\n obtained without intravenous contrast. N.B. Patient mentioned his concern\n regarding "toxicity" of intravenous contrast at the time of scanning and\n declined it as he has in the past (per technologist\'s report). Coronal and\n sagittal reformations were performed.\n\n COMPARISON:  [**3102-4-10**], and CT chest and CT abdomen/pelvis from [**3099-3-16**].\n\n CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a small interval decrease in the size\n of the left basilar hydropneumothorax.  The residual patchy airspace disease\n in the left lung base may be atelectatic, superimposed on\n stable bronchiectasis, likely the sequela of recent infectious consolidation\n at this site. There are no pleural abnormalities identified on the left.\n There are calcifications of the pleura on the right. There is trace fluid in\n the major fissure, but no frank effusion on the right. There is no new\n consolidation. The right upper lobe linear opacities are unchanged and likely\n represent scar. The right basilar opacities are similar, with atelectasis as\n well as a small area of traction bronchiectasis at the right lung base, also\n likely due to more remote infection. The airways are patent to the\n subsegmental level.\n\n Coronary artery calcifications are again seen. The relatively low attenuation\n of the blood within vessels is consistent with anemia. There is no hilar or\n mediastinal adenopathy.\n\n CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The liver, pancreas,  adrenals and kidneys\n are normal.  The spleen is quite small, unchanged. This raises the question of\n prior autoinfarction in this setting. The large and small bowel are normal.\n There is no free air or free fluid.  There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal\n adenopathy.\n\n CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The bladder, rectum, and sigmoid are normal.\n There is no inguinal or pelvic adenopathy.  There is a fat-containing inguinal\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**3102-5-1**] 8:09 AM\n CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST; CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST                  Clip # [**0-0-**]\n CT PELVIS W/O CONTRAST\n Reason: history of hydropneumothorax.

The calcifications about the prostate, base of the bladder\n and at the right side of the base of the penis are unchanged, likely\n phleboliths. There are three soft tissue nodules in the left flank, which were\n not seen in [**3098**], the largest measuring 1.4cm in axial diameter, of uncertain\n significance.\n\n MUSCULOSKELETAL:  There are osteophytes in the lumbar spine consistent with\n DJD.  The wedge-shaped deformities in the thoracic vertebrae are unchanged and\n may be relate to remodelling from underlying extramedullary hematopoeisis.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n 1.  Slight interval decrease in the size of left basilar hydropneumothorax.\n\n 2.  Persistent bibasilar linear atelectasis, with some traction\n bronchiectasis, likely post-inflammatory. No new consolidation.\n\n 3.  New subcutaneous nodules in the left flank, which may simply\n represent injection sites, but should be correlated clinically. In this\n context, leukemic infiltration or opportunistic infection are considerations.\n\n 4.  Small spleen which may relate to prior "autoinfarction."\n\n\n',

The extent of circumferential left pleural thickening has\n increased minimally, as one would expect with chronic pleural effusion whether\n or not it is infected.  The absence of growth or evidence of any infiltration\n of the adjacent chest wall argue against infection.  Mild contraction of the\n left hemithorax is stable.  Moderate degree of atelectasis in the left lower\n lobe is slightly different in distribution, but not in overall severity.  The\n 14 mm long oblong soft tissue opacity in the right upper lobe, 3:17, probably\n an impacted bronchus, has been present without appreciable change since [**2-17**], [**3100**].  Heterogeneity in the background density of the lungs reflecting\n small airways obstruction has also been present for some time.  Lung suture\n and pleural calcification on the right reflect prior wedge resection biopsy.\n Right pleural effusion has resolved. There are no lung lesions concerning for\n active infection or idiopathic pneumonitis.  Small pericardial effusion is\n slightly larger today.\n\n IMPRESSION:  Multiloculated moderate-size left basal hydropneumothorax stable\n since [**3102-6-24**].  Given stability, infection is unlikely, though not\n excluded. No evidence of chest wall infection.  Mild volume loss in the left\n lung due to lower lobe atelectasis is stable.\n\n Variable lung attenuation and small mucoid impaction, right upper lobe suggest\n reactive airways, longstanding.\n\n\n\n',

Followup for staging to rule out recurrence.\n\n TECHNIQUE: Very limited examination consisting only of axial T1W pre-contrast\n sequences. N.B. The patient declined IV contrast and to complete the exam.\n\n COMPARISON:  MRIs of the neck soft tissues, dated [**3102-2-1**] and [**3101-9-11**], the\n latter with contrast enhancement.\n\n FINDINGS:\n\n Anterior to the right lateral pterygoid muscle, in the right masticator space\n (4:10 through 13), there is asymmetric prominence of the soft tissue, when\n compared to the left. This sharply-marginated geographic region of relative\n [**Name (NI) 39413**] is not significantly changed in size or configuration when\n compared with [**3101-9-11**] study, at which time, it demonstrated T2-hyperintensity\n and modest enhancement.

The\n right maxillary sinus demonstrates persistent opacification when compared to\n the prior exam.  The left maxillary sinus and much of the nasal cavity are now\n well-aerated.\n\n The soft tissue planes are overall well preserved. There is no gross regional\n lymphadenopathy.

Evaluate for sinusitis.\n\n CT SINUS:  Helical imaging was performed through the paranasal sinuses without\n IV contrast administration.  Sagittal and coronal reformations were prepared.\n\n COMPARISON:  MRI neck, [**3103-5-18**], [**3103-4-9**], CT sinus [**3101-7-16**].\n\n FINDINGS:  There is complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus\n extending into the right ethmoid air cells and into the right frontal sinus.\n This finding appears similar to MRI examination from [**3103-5-18**], although\n was incompletely assessed at this time. There is extensive bony remodeling\n with evidence for development of lucencies along the right inferior orbital\n wall, right inferior floor of the right maxillary sinus, lateral wall of the\n right maxillary sinus and posterior wall of the right maxillary sinus.  The\n left maxillary sinus and left ethmoid air cells appear clear.  There is\n minimal mucosal thickening of the left sphenoid sinus, but no bony destruction\n or erosion. There is [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 13594**] type 1 bilaterally.  The right posterior\n maxillary molar may protrude into the right maxillary sinus (401B:33).\n\n The patient is apparently status post right facial flap reconstruction with a\n large component of fat.  Deep to this flap, is a 2.1 x 0.7 cm fluid collection\n which appears similar to MRI examination from [**3103-5-18**]. There are\n multiple surgical clips deep to the flap.  In addition, there appears to be a\n surgical anchor at the patient's anterior nasal bone (2:43).\n\n The orbits appear intact.  In the white matter of the left frontal, temporal\n and parietal lobes, there is significant edema which was incompletely\n visualized on MRI of neck from [**3103-5-18**].

Remaining intracranial contents appear normal without evidence for\n midline shift, hydrocephalus, or mass effect.  There are degenerative changes\n of bilateral TMJs with minimal anterior subluxation of the left TMJ (400A:68).\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n 1.  Complete opacification of the right maxillary sinus, near complete\n opacification of the right ethmoid air cells and complete opacification of the\n right frontal sinus with bony changes as described.

Complete\n opacification of the right frontal, ethmoid and maxillary sinus is unchanged.\n There is a permeative bony change in the surrounding bone of the maxillary\n sinus which is stable.  There is soft tissue in the right OMU. There is\n minimal left sphenoid sinus opacification.  The left frontal sinus is\n hypoplastic.  There appear to be post-surgical changes in the right neck and\n myocutaneous flap.  Extensive hypodensity and calcifications in the right\n frontal and temporal lobe are unchanged.\n\n There is a bony spur of the nasal septum to the right.  There is right\n periorbital edema.\n\n There is a low-density lesion within the right buccal space extending to the\n pterygomaxillary fissure which is likely to be postoperative in nature.  This\n is relatively stable compared to the prior examination.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n 1.  Unchanged extensive right-sided sinus opacification.  There is a\n permeative appearance of the walls of the right maxillary sinus which could be\n related to pressure erosion from bacterial or fungal sinusitis.\n\n 2.  Unchanged hypodensities and calcifications within the brain, which could\n be radiation related.\n\n 3.  Postop changes in the right face, this study is not sensitive to evaluate\n for tumor recurrence given the lack of intravenous contrast.\n\n\n\n',

There is extensive nodular\n mucoperiosteal thickening throughout the maxillary sinuses with air-fluid\n levels present.  There is fluid within the bilateral mastoid air cells, as\n well as within the posterior nasopharynx, which may relate to intubation.\n\n MRA:  The intracranial internal carotid arteries are normal.

[The noncontrast CT images\n are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of\n overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose\n level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 102 mg/dL. The area\n imaged spanned the vertex to the base of the skull.\n\n Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET\n images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The\n determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important\n implications regarding the significance of that uptake.\n\n INTERPRETATION:\n There is diffusely decreased FDG-uptake throughout the brain, of unknown\n etiology.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 22**],\n the attending radiologist, reviewed the study.\n\n ANESTHESIA:  Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of\n 25 mcg of fentanyl throughout the total intra-service time of 30 minutes\n during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were continuously monitored.\n\n TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  After the risks and benefits of the procedure were\n explained to the patient, written informed consent was obtained.  The patient\n was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table.\n The right neck was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  A pre-\n procedure timeout and huddle were performed per standard [**Hospital1 10**] protocol.\n Fluoroscopy of the chest was obtained demonstrating a tracheostomy tube and\n nasogastric tube in standard positions.  Using sterile technique, and\n ultrasound guidance, a micropuncture needle was used to access the right\n internal jugular vein. Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained for the\n medical record.  A 0.018 wire was advanced through the needle into the SVC\n with fluoroscopic guidance. The needle was exchanged for a micropuncture\n sheath which was used to upsize the wire to [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 7**] wire.  After appropriate\n measurements were made, the micropuncture sheath was removed and the tissues\n were dilated with soft tissue dilator.  Next, a 16 cm triple-lumen central\n venous catheter was advanced over the wire with its tip positioned in the\n distal SVC.  The wire was removed. Catheter was secured to the skin with 0\n silk suture, flushed and aspirated. Sterile dressings were applied.  The\n patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complication.\n\n IMPRESSION:  Complicated placement of a double-lumen 16 cm temporary\n hemodialysis catheter with the tip positioned in the right atrium.  The\n catheter is ready to use.\n\n\n",

The upper abdomen was prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.\n A preprocedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 10**] protocol.\n\n Under ultrasound guidance, the left margin of the liver was marked on the\n skin.  The patient had an indwelling NG tube which was placed on the floor and\n this was used to insufflate the stomach with air.  Fluoroscopy was used to\n outline the stomach and transverse colon.  After identifying a safe window for\n G-tube placement, local anesthesia obtained with 1% lidocaine.  Under\n fluoroscopic guidance, three T-fasteners were inserted sequentially through\n the anterior abdominal wall into the stomach and tightened, elevating the\n stomach wall to the anterior abdominal wall.  A small skin incision was made\n between the T-fasteners and a 19-gauge needle was introduced into the stomach\n under fluoroscopic guidance.

      "MICU NPN 11AM-7PM:\nNeuro: Pt awake and alert, very discouraged and upset he is so weak and irritated by the fact he has to take so many meds. I went in to give him his noon meds and his 8AM meds were waiting to be taken. Some of them were on the floor and some were mixed in the sheets. I discussed with him the importance of taking his meds on time. He told me he was too tired and SOB to eat and needs to eat in order to take his pills. Team in to discuss these things on rounds and will adjust cardiac meds to extended release formulas to decrease frequency of meds. Team also recommends using bi-pap intermittently throughout the day to let pt rest so he can eat his meals. This did work when tried today. Pt able to eat lunch after he rested on bi-pap 1330-1500. Pt using call bell at times. Unsteady on his feet and needs assist to commode. Denied pain but has extreme skin sensitivity due to GVH disease of skin. A+O times three.\n\nCV: Remains slightly hypertensive on metoptolol and diltiazem PO. BP 140-170's. HR 60-80 NSR. Refusing sc heparin becasue he says he is moving around enough in the bed and the room. Frequent nose bleeds noted.\n\nResp: Pt on 4L N/C and is dyspneic at rest which increases with exertion. Looks poor at times. Congested productive cough noted, sputum frothy white. Rested on bi-pap for 90 minutes today. Lungs coarse with deminished breath sounds at bases bilaterally.\n\nGI: Poor appetite. Pt said he had diarrhea stool this AM before I came in.\n\nGU: VOids clear yellow urine in urinal without difficulty.\n\nID: afebrile on vanco/zosyn as well as two flu meds, tamiflu and amantidine. Remains on droplet precautions for influenza A.\n\nSocial: I spoke to pt's wife who will be back at 1800 to stay again for the night. She is concerned that he is watched closely and that his light is answered quickly because he tends to get up on his own if light is not answered quickly. This is why she stays with him at night.\n\nIV: L PICC in place and works well. Both ports are accessed with KVO.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
