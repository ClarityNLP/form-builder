Linear areas of\n opacity at the left base likely represent a combination of scarring and\n atelectasis.  No definite pleural abnormalities are identified; however,\n assessment is slightly limited by lack of intravenous contrast.  There is no\n right-sided pleural effusion.  No focal consolidations seen within the lungs.\n Linear opacities at the right upper lobe are unchanged from prior, likely\n representing scar.  There has been interval improvement of previously seen\n right basilar opacities.  Bibasilar bronchiectasis now identified, left\n greater than right, likely representing sequelae of prior infection.  Airways\n appear patent to the subsegmental level.\n\n There is no pericardial effusion.  Coronary artery calcifications are\n identified.

After identifying a safe window for\n G-tube placement, local anesthesia obtained with 1% lidocaine.  Under\n fluoroscopic guidance, three T-fasteners were inserted sequentially through\n the anterior abdominal wall into the stomach and tightened, elevating the\n stomach wall to the anterior abdominal wall.  A small skin incision was made\n between the T-fasteners and a 19-gauge needle was introduced into the stomach\n under fluoroscopic guidance.

Has loculated recurrent hydropneumothorax.  Please evaluate for\n fistula.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired axial images of the chest were obtained with\n intravenous contrast using CTA protocol.  Coronal and oblique reformats were\n performed.  This was preceded by a non-contrast scan of the chest.\n\n COMPARISON:  [**3102-4-10**], [**3102-5-1**].\n\n FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of central, segmental or subsegmental filling\n defects to suggest a pulmonary embolus. Coronary calcifications are again\n seen. The right upper lobe linear opacities are unchanged, likely scar.  The\n left base patchy air space disease is again noted. The hydropneumothorax is\n similar to prior study. There is a bronchopleural fistula on the left (4A,\n 102-104). There is diffuse ground-glass opacity which appears markedly worse\n than on prior study.\n\n Although this exam is not tailored for subdiaphragmatic evaluation the\n visualized upper abdomen is normal.\n\n BONE WINDOWS:  There is DJD in the spine. The wedge-shaped deformities in the\n thoracic vertebrae which are unchanged.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n 1.  No evidence of pulmonary embolus.\n 2.

Patient has IR-placed G-tube in place but is not able to tolerate\n feeds through the catheter in to stomach.  A request was placed for conversion\n of G- tube to a dual-lumen G-J tube.\n\n CLINICIANS:  Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 3082**] [**Name (STitle) **] and Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 765**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 22**].  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 22**] is the\n attending radiologist who was present and supervising throughout.\n\n ANESTHESIA:  Moderate sedation was provided by administering divided doses of\n 75 mcg of fentanyl and 1 mg of Versed throughout the total intra-service time\n of 65 minutes during which the patient's hemodynamic parameters were\n continuously monitored.  Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine and lidocaine gel.\n\n PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  An informed written consent was obtained from\n patient's wife who is his healthcare proxy after explaining the procedure,\n benefits, alternatives and risks involved.  The patient was brought to the\n angiography suite and placed supine on the imaging table.  The upper abdomen\n including the existing G-tube were prepped and draped in the usual sterile\n fashion.  A pre-procedure huddle and timeout were performed as per [**Hospital1 10**]\n protocol.\n\n An initial scout image of the abdomen was obtained demonstrating the G-tube in\n satisfactory position, which was confirmed by contrast injection.  Then the\n catheter was cut distal to the hub releasing the locking mechanism.  A 0.035\n [**Last Name (un) 414**] wire was placed through the catheter into the stomach and the catheter\n removed.  A 7 French x 11 cm vascular sheath was placed over the guidewire.  A\n second wire, 0.035 angled Glidewire was placed through the sheath and sheath\n replaced over the Glidewire using the [**Last Name (un) 414**] wire as a safety wire.  Through\n the sheath a Kumpe catheter was placed and using the combination of Kumpe\n catheter and Glidewire, the wire was advanced into proximal jejunum.  Then the\n Glidewire was removed and replaced with guidewire from MIC G/J tube set.  Then\n both the Kumpe catheter and vascular sheath were removed.  A peel-away sheath\n was placed over the guidewire and inner dilator removed.  A 16 French MIC G-J\n tube was placed over the guidewire, through the peel-away sheath and advanced\n into jejunum.  The peel-away sheath was removed.  The balloon was inflated\n with 16 cc of saline mixed with contrast and the plastic disc approximated to\n the abdominal wall.  The position of the catheter confirmed by contrast\n injection. The plastic disc was secured to the skin with 0 silk sutures.\n Sterile dressings were applied.  The patient tolerated the procedure well and\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**3104-1-26**] 12:11 PM\n PERC G/G-J TUBE PLMT                                            Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 40004**]\n Reason: g-j tube placement\n  Contrast: OPTIRAY Amt: 25\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n (Cont)\n there were no immediate complications.\n\n IMPRESSION:  Successful conversion from G-tube to G-J tube, placing a 16\n French MIC G-J feeding tube.

[The noncontrast CT images\n are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of\n overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose\n level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 102 mg/dL. The area\n imaged spanned the vertex to the base of the skull.\n\n Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET\n images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The\n determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important\n implications regarding the significance of that uptake.\n\n INTERPRETATION:\n There is diffusely decreased FDG-uptake throughout the brain, of unknown\n etiology.  There is more focal decreased uptake of FDG in the right\n fronto-temporal lobe, corresponding to the region of hypoattenuation and\n calcification on CT, with no focal hypermetabolic areas within this region.\n\n FDG-avidity in the left forehead, just above the orbit, measures SUV 5.3 and\n corresponds to mild focal thickening of the soft tissues.\n\n IMPRESSION:  1. Diffusely decreased FDG activity within the brain with focal\n decreased FDG-avidity in the right fronto-temporal lobe, corresponding to the\n abnormalities on MR/CT, of uncertain cause.  Malignancy and acute encephalitis\n tend to be FDG-avid, while chronic encephalitis may be hypometabolic.   2.\n FDG-avidity in the left forehead, just above the orbit, corresponds to mild\n focal thickening of the soft tissues on CT and correlation with physical exam is\n recommended.\n\n\n         [**Name6 (MD) 2668**] [**Name8 (MD) 2669**], M.D.\n         [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 631**], M.D.              Approved: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 456**] [**3103-12-15**] 3:13 PM\n\n\n\n\n               RADLINE [**Telephone/Fax (1) 94**]; A radiology consult service.\n            To hear preliminary results, prior to transcription, call the\n                           Radiology Listen Line [**Telephone/Fax (1) 95**].\n\n',

EVAL FOR RIGHT TEMPORAL LESIONS\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n\n RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL DATA:\n    10.4 mCi F-18 FDG ([**3103-12-14**]);\n HISTORY:  CML, chronic GVHD, and mass in the right temporo-parietal\n\n METHODS: Approximately 1 hour after intravenous administration of F-18\n fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), noncontrast CT images were obtained for attenuation\n correction and for fusion with emission PET images. [The noncontrast CT images\n are not used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.]  A series of\n overlapping emission PET images was then obtained. The fasting blood glucose\n level, measured by glucometer before injection of FDG, was 102 mg/dL. The area\n imaged spanned the vertex to the base of the skull.\n\n Computed tomography (CT) images were co-registered and fused with emission PET\n images to assist with the anatomic localization of tracer uptake.  The\n determination of the site of tracer uptake seen on PET data can have important\n implications regarding the significance of that uptake.\n\n INTERPRETATION:\n There is diffusely decreased FDG-uptake throughout the brain, of unknown\n etiology.  There is more focal decreased uptake of FDG in the right\n fronto-temporal lobe, corresponding to the region of hypoattenuation and\n calcification on CT, with no focal hypermetabolic areas within this region.\n\n FDG-avidity in the left forehead, just above the orbit, measures SUV 5.3 and\n corresponds to mild focal thickening of the soft tissues.\n\n IMPRESSION:  1. Diffusely decreased FDG activity within the brain with focal\n decreased FDG-avidity in the right fronto-temporal lobe, corresponding to the\n abnormalities on MR/CT, of uncertain cause.  Malignancy and acute encephalitis\n tend to be FDG-avid, while chronic encephalitis may be hypometabolic.   2.\n FDG-avidity in the left forehead, just above the orbit, corresponds to mild\n focal thickening of the soft tissues on CT and correlation with physical exam is\n recommended.\n\n\n         [**Name6 (MD) 2668**] [**Name8 (MD) 2669**], M.D.\n         [**Last Name (NamePattern5) 631**], M.D.              Approved: [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 456**] [**3103-12-15**] 3:13 PM\n\n\n\n\n               RADLINE [**Telephone/Fax (1) 94**]; A radiology consult service.\n            To hear preliminary results, prior to transcription, call the\n                           Radiology Listen Line [**Telephone/Fax (1) 95**].\n\n',

Images are presented for display in the axial\n plane at 5-mm and 1.25-mm collimation.  A series of multiplanar reformation\n images were also submitted for review.\n\n FINDINGS:  Several areas of scarring and fibrosis involving the lower lobes,\n lingula and right lung apex appear unchanged, and remain most severe within\n the left lower lobe.  Newly developed smooth septal thickening is present,\n accompanied by subtle areas of ground-glass attenuation, most pronounced\n within the upper lobes and extreme bases.  Additionally, a new area of\n subpleural rectangular opacification has developed in the periphery of the\n left upper lobe (image 65, series 4) similar to a pre-existing peripheral\n opacification within the lingula. Chronic mosaic pattern of lung attenuation\n is unchanged.\n\n A new small right pleural effusion has also developed, extending into the\n right major fissure.  Chronic loculated left pleural effusion with smooth\n pleural thickening is similar in size to the prior CT of [**3102-7-4**] but the\n locules of gas within the collection have resolved.\n\n Heart size is normal.  Coronary artery calcifications are present.  Small\n pericardial effusion is unchanged.  Right-sided pleural calcifications are\n also unchanged.\n\n Exam was not specifically tailored to evaluate the subdiaphragmatic region,\n but no concerning new abnormalities are identified in this region on this\n limited assessment.\n\n No suspicious lytic or blastic skeletal lesions are detected.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n 1.

Chronic graft-versus-host\n disease and worsening dyspnea.  Evaluate for possible infection.\n\n TECHNIQUE:  Volumetric, multidetector CT of the chest was performed without\n intravenous or oral contrast.  Images are presented for display in the axial\n plane at 5-mm and 1.25-mm collimation.  A series of multiplanar reformation\n images were also submitted for review.\n\n FINDINGS:  Several areas of scarring and fibrosis involving the lower lobes,\n lingula and right lung apex appear unchanged, and remain most severe within\n the left lower lobe.  Newly developed smooth septal thickening is present,\n accompanied by subtle areas of ground-glass attenuation, most pronounced\n within the upper lobes and extreme bases.  Additionally, a new area of\n subpleural rectangular opacification has developed in the periphery of the\n left upper lobe (image 65, series 4) similar to a pre-existing peripheral\n opacification within the lingula. Chronic mosaic pattern of lung attenuation\n is unchanged.\n\n A new small right pleural effusion has also developed, extending into the\n right major fissure.  Chronic loculated left pleural effusion with smooth\n pleural thickening is similar in size to the prior CT of [**3102-7-4**] but the\n locules of gas within the collection have resolved.\n\n Heart size is normal.  Coronary artery calcifications are present.  Small\n pericardial effusion is unchanged.  Right-sided pleural calcifications are\n also unchanged.\n\n Exam was not specifically tailored to evaluate the subdiaphragmatic region,\n but no concerning new abnormalities are identified in this region on this\n limited assessment.\n\n No suspicious lytic or blastic skeletal lesions are detected.\n\n IMPRESSION:\n\n 1. New smooth septal thickening and minimal ground-glass attenuation as well\n as a new small right pleural effusion.  The constellation of findings is most\n                                                             (Over)\n\n [**3103-10-2**] 2:24 PM\n CT CHEST W/O CONTRAST                                           Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 39418**]\n Reason: please eval for infectious source or other abnormality.

Labs notable for WBC 11K, HCT 22, K 4.3, Cr 3.2.\n   Agree with plan to manage multifactorial respiratory failure with vent\n   support and PSV wean; continue azithro and pred for BO, HD for volume\n   removal and IP consult for R thoracentesis to assist in weaning. Will\n   consider TM trials after procedures. Trach bleed stable, will confirm\n   no TIF on final CT read. ARF continues with minimal UOP, tolerating HD,\n   would favor aggressive volume removal to assist in weaning. Atrial\n   flutter\n dilt / metoprolol per NGT. Keppra for TL mass / possible\n   seizures - give after HD. Will d/w BMT re acyclovir and bactrim\n   prophylaxis, continue fluconazole. Resume TFs today, monitor FSG.

CML s/p allogenic transplant,\n   chronic GVH, bronchiolitis obliterans s/p recent discharge for\n   worsening dyspnea presented to the ED with hypoxia and altered mental\n   status.\n   On review of the pt's records it appears as if he was recently admitted\n   for a week for a LLL PNA, treated with a course of XX and discharged\n   yesterday. He was noted to have consolidation on CT chest and was going\n   to be treated at home with Levofloxacin and home O2. Unfortunately he\n   was not able to get his oxygen set up and he was admitted for his\n   dyspnea. During his admission it appears he was altered (?delirium)\n   remarking on voices telling him things per his wife. On review of OMR\n   it appears he signed out AMA, refused IV antibiotics, further\n   evaluation for his altered mental status and hypercarbia. He was\n   discharged on a regimen of Augmentin.\n   In the ED initial VS were noted to be BP 178/116, HR 130, Sat 91%. He\n   underwent a CXR which showed LLL infiltration/effusion. For his altered\n   mental status he underwent a CT head which showed an unchanged\n   hypodensity on R fontal and a new 6 mm hyperdense focus in the left\n   temporal lobe, ?mets versus hemorrhage. Neurology were consulted in the\n   ED and determined that his presentation could be infectious and\n   recommended an LP which was performed in the ED. Pt was started\n   empirically on Acyclovir, Ceftriaxone, Vanc, Flagyl.\n   .\n   On the floor he was noted to be range from non-verbal to verbal.\n   History was obtained via pt's wife.\n   Allergies:\n   Amphotericin B\n   Unknown;\n   Ambisome (Intraven.)

PNA: One review of prior films PNA appears to have progressed.\n   During his hospitalization he was treated with IV XX and discharged on\n   a course of Augementin x 10 days. Will continue on Ceftriaxone,\n   Levofloxacin for CAP, Vancomycin for HAP given recent\n   hospitalizations.\n   .\n   ##. Altered Mental Status: Ddx include delirium, meningitis, metastatic\n   disease. On review of pt's mentation prior to his AMA discharge I\n   suspect his mental status may be acute delirium from his underlying PNA\n   that was only able to be partially treated. Particularly given that at\n   times pt is non-verbal and at others he is able to speak. Other ddx to\n   consider given the fevers is meningitis. Will f/u on LP labs, HSV PCR.\n   Pt was noted to have auditory hallucinations which is interesting given\n   the ?mass in her temporal lobe. Would expect more focal signs though as\n   opposed to global. Neurology were consulted in the ED and recommended\n   infectious work up, MRI/MRA, U/A, avoid psychotrophics\n   - will check MRI/MRA brain w/ and w/o contrast\n   - will check U/A, LFTs\n   - will avoid psychotropics, consider seroquel\n   - f/u LP, add on HSV\n   - given LP is negative will d/c Ceftriaxone\n   - treat underlying PNA\n   - reorient qshift\n   .\n   ##. CML s/p transplant: complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis\n   obliterans. Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue\n   on outpatient Prednisone dose.\n   .\n   ##. HTN: Pt noted to have HTN with BP in 160s, HR 120s-130s. Baseline\n   HR usually low 100s, likely due to adrenergic tone from agitation. Will\n   start on Labetalol.\n   .\n   ##.

Patient being treated for encephalitis, although CSF without\n   cells. Due for additional MRI to further characterize the CNS lesions.\n   Patient probably has a post-hypercapnic metabolic alkalosis now.\n   Baseline bicarb last admission was 42; he has likely been\n   overventilated from baseline status and is likely not to be able to\n   sustain spontaneous ventilation at this level of PaCO2. Following MRI\n   today, will stop propofol and assess RSBI. If he fails, I would then\n   resedate and ventilate him such that PaCO2 is in low 50's to achieve pH\n   less than 7.35; as bicarb comes up, further reduce ventilation and\n   achieve higher PaCO2.\n   Nutrition remains a problem because of difficulty getting access for\n   enteral or IV nutrition. Will discuss possibility of an OG tube with\n   Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 1382**].\n   Hyponatremia stable.

Altered Mental Status: Ddx still includes intermittent seizure vs.\n   intracranial disease (glioma vs toxo vs other) vs. delirium. This\n   presentation seems to be acute on chronic AMS.  We must r/o viral\n   meningitises/encephalitises.  Will f/u on LP labs, HSV PCR. Pt was\n   noted to have auditory hallucinations which is interesting given the\n   ?mass in his temporal lobe.\n   Delerium:\n          - continue ABX for PNA as below\n          - IV Vanc(AM trough looked good, restarting at 1gm q24hr),\n   levaquin\n d/c Cefepime\n   Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis:\n          - awaiting results of HSV, HHV-6, JCV, EBV\n nothing back yet\n          - all culture data is negative so far\n          - continue Acyclovir\n   Seizure:  No active seizure activity on EEG making status less likely,\n   it is possible that he is intermittently seizing though.\n            - Phosfenytoin loaded in anticipation of Neurosurgical\n   procedure.\n   Intracranial Disease Process:\n            - Neurosurgery consulted, likely to biopsy Tuesday (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]\n            - Plan is as follows -> remain intubated, ASL MRI tomorrow,\n   extubate -> Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] to present at tumor board on Monday, possible Bx\n   on Tuesday.\n    .\n   Toxic Metabolic:\n            - TSH is 7, likely to be sick euthyroid will check other\n   levels\n            - B12 WNL\n            - RPR non-reactive\n   .\n   Increased WOB/Respiratory faillure:  Patient intubated for tachypnea,\n   likely impending respiratory faillure.  Gas looked acidemic with\n   retained PCO2, ? oversedation with decreased respiratory drive, patient\n   had been 30-50 all day.\n             - would leave patient intubated pending MRI\n             - would not prolong nasal intubation given underlying sinus\n   disease\n   .\n   Hyponatremia/ARF\n Urine lytes pre-renal, responded to IVF today.  Bump\n   in BUN relative to CRE, and hyponatremia, suspect pre-renal azotemia\n   and hypovolemic hyponatremia.\n   - Continue prn NS boluses\n   - check urine lytes\n   - Check PM lytes\n   .\n   ##. PNA: One review of prior films PNA appears to have progressed.\n   During his hospitalization he was treated with IV Vanc, Cefepime,\n   levaquin currently.\n   .\n   ##. CML s/p transplant: complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis\n   obliterans. Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue\n   on outpatient Prednisone dose.\n   - confirm various ppx meds\n   .\n   ##. HTN: Pt noted to have HTN with BP in 160s, HR 120s-130s. Baseline\n   HR usually low 100s, likely due to adrenergic tone from agitation. Will\n   start on Labetalol.\n   - labetalol 10mg q6h for now\n   - ?autonomic dysregulation versus infection\n   .\n   ##. FEN: tube feeding consult in, replete PRN\n   .\n   ##.

Patient closer to\n   hypercapneic baseline with current settings.   Will attempt to wean off\n   the vent at this point, barriers to extubation include LOS fluid + 15\n   liters.\n   -Lasix drip\n with goal\n([**1-7**]) liters per day\n   - Presure support/wean as tolerated\n   - Concentrate and d/c unnecessary antibiotics(vanc today)\n   .\n   ##. Unclear progress of Altered Mental Status: Ddx still includes\n   intermittent seizure vs. intracranial disease (glioma vs toxo vs other)\n   vs. delirium. This presentation seems to be acute on chronic AMS.  We\n   must r/o viral meningitises/encephalitises.  Will f/u on LP labs, HSV\n   PCR. Pt was noted to have auditory hallucinations which is interesting\n   given the ?mass in his temporal lobe.\n   Seizure:  During our brief windows into his mental status, off sedation\n   his mental status is HIGHLY variable, I have a STRONG clinical\n   suspicion that he is intermittently seizing and would benefit form 24\n   hour EEG monitoring.  Neuro help is greatly appreciated, they are\n   trying to arrange either 20 minute or 24 hour.\n            - Bolus sedation\n            - re-load phosphenytoin after EEG\n 1G Fosphenytoin once,\n   check a peak after 2 hours, maintainence levels 150mg Q8 check a level\n   in [**4-8**] days\n   Delerium:\n          - treatment dose abx should be d/c\nd, no microorganisms on\n   sputum\n   Encephalitis/Viral Meningitis:\n          - awaiting results of HSV, HHV-6, JCV, EBV\n All negative\n          - Serum cryptococcus is negative, toxo IgG, IgM - negative\n          - all culture data is negative\n          - Change Acyclovir to ppx dosing\n   Intracranial Disease Process:\n            - No biopsy\n   Toxic Metabolic:\n            - TSH is 7, likely to be sick euthyroid will check other\n   levels\n            - B12 WNL\n            - RPR non-reactive\n   .\n   Hyponatremia/ARF\n Will tolerate hypontremia, and ARF as total body\n   fluid overload is a barrier to extubation.  Lack of drop in sodium and\n   change in BUN/CRE likely represent intravascular redistribution of\n   third spaced fluids.  Would also question role of bactrim.\n   - hold boluses\n   - Check urine lytes\n   - Check PM lytes\n   - D/C bactrim, ppx otherwise\n   .\n   ##. PNA: along with prior hospital course has received an extended\n   course of abx.  Would stop if todays sputum is negative.\n   .\n   ##. CML s/p transplant: complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis\n   obliterans. Pt was on Prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue\n   on outpatient Prednisone dose.\n   - confirm various ppx meds\n   .\n   ##. HTN: Pt noted to have HTN with BP in 160s, HR 120s-130s. Baseline\n   HR usually low 100s, likely due to adrenergic tone from agitation.\n   ?autonomic dysregulation versus infection.\n   - restart labetalol\n   .\n   ##. FEN: unable to pass OG tube [**1-5**] intolerance, Will ask Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1705**] to\n   discuss IR guided OG tube with family.\n   .\n   ##. CODE STATUS: full\n   .\n   ##.

Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1705**] will discuss PEG with the family\n   shortly.\n   - f/u S&S eval tomorrow.\n   - NPO for now\n   .\n ATRIAL FLUTTER (AFLUTTER) with [**Last Name (STitle) 843**]\n   PO Diltiazem would be ideal however given he could not tolerate any PO\n   meds this AM and he is currently requiring a diltiazem gtt. Speech and\n   swallow are aware of him and will see him today. Adenosine EKG shows\n   clear A. flutter 2:1 with a rate of 150. t EP consult felt that D/C\n   cardioversion would be definitive treatment for A. Flutter, however\n   with new pneumonitis would hold off unitl\nnidus\n resolves. Further D/C\n   Cardioversion is complicated by the difficulty in protecting his airway\n   for sedation, and amiodarone is obviously a poor choice given his\n   underlying bonchiolitis obliterans.  Pt has h.o. of Heparin allergy. In\n   terms of the causes of his A. flutter with [**Name (NI) 843**] pt recently had an Echo\n   performed [**12-2**] which showed no evidence of valvular disease given his\n   history ischaemic injury is also low on the differential. Will check\n   TSH, T4 level.\n   - continue IV diltiazem gtt if pt is persistently in A. flutter with\n   [**Month/Day (4) 843**]\n   - Speech & swallow assessment tomorrow to determine whether pt is OK to\n   start PO regimen which would be ideal\n   - if no PO, would discuss PEG with family\n   - Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1705**] to discuss ablation with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Will need\n   bivalirudin if we are considering ablation and wait until tomorrow\n   .\n   Chemical Pneumonitis: Pt noted to have a RLL infiltrate on CXR, likely\n   chemical pneumonitis from his aspiration event. No leukocytosis is\n   noted on lab draw, no fevers. His A. flutter predates his aspiration\n   event so it is unlikely to be the cause of his A. flutter. It could be\n   a factor in keep him in flutter if it develops into a PNA. Will not\n   treat for aspiration PNA given lack of infectious signs. If pt become\n   febrile or demonstrates leukocytosis would have a low threshold to put\n   on abx coverage for aspiration PNA.\n   .\n ALKALOSIS, METABOLIC\n   Likely contraction alkalosis given his recent history of poor PO\n   intake. His Creatinine is 1.0, which is likely high given his current\n   body habitus. Pt currently receiving NS IVF given his low BP prior to\n   dilt gtt initiation. Will continue to monitor I/Os, pt is going to\n   undergo speech and swallow eval today. On prior discussions with the\n   family they have decided against PEG tubes. NGT would be undesirable\n   given his severe sinus disease and recent nasal intubation.\n   - f/u S&S tomorrow\n   - follow electrolytes\n   .\n   Acute Kidney Injury\n   Suspect pre-renal for the same reason as above.\n   -Bolus 1L NS\n   .\n .H/O CANCER (MALIGNANT NEOPLASM), OTHER\n   Complicated by chronic GVHD and bronchiolitis obliterans. Pt was on\n   prednisone taper as an outpatient, will continue on IV\n   methylprednisolone equivalent dose as he is strictly NPO.\n   - cont methylpred, for the moment with plans for taper\n   - cont ppx with azithromycin, bactrim and acyclovir IV\n   .\n ANEMIA, OTHER\n   Pt has chronic anemia with prior Hcts noted to be 25-26. On admission\n   is Hct was 33, however may be hemoconcentrated as he was clinically dry\n   on exam. Repeat Hct from floor draw was 19, no reports of hematochezia,\n   melena. Will review Metavision records to determine if pt had a femoral\n   line which would place him at risk for RP bld. However given the time\n   interval would be atypical.\n   - will recheck Hct\n ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)\n   Pt was initially admitted with AMS that was thought to be possibly\n   seizures given his known temporal lobe mass versus delirium given his\n   initial underlying PNA. Since his extubation last week he has remained\n   orientated to person, place, time.\n   - cont to monitor patient for signs of AMS\n   ICU Care\n   Nutrition: NPO for now, replete lytes\n   Glycemic Control:\n   Lines: Rt Midline, 2 ports\n   Prophylaxis:\n   DVT: Pneumoboots\n   Stress ulcer: PPI IV\n   VAP:\n   Comments:\n   Communication:  Comments:\n   Code status: Full code\n   Disposition: Pending resolution of symptoms\n   ------ Protected Section ------\n\n',
